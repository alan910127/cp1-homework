# Competitive Programming 1 -- Homework

> cpp standard: `c++17` <br>
> Compile with the option `-std=c++17` turned on.

## Skills

- Range-based for loop: `for (type var : iterable)`
    - e.g. `for (auto i : nums) { }`
    - requirement: C++11 or higher.
- Structured binding: `auto [identifier-list] = expression;`
    - e.g. `auto [x, y] = position;`
    - requirement: C++17 or higher.
- `std::valarray`
    - Fast for arithmetic operations.
    - Supporting operations apply to the whole array, such as `v1 = a * v2 + c;`.
    - Useful in implementing FFT (see hw05 `kinversions.cpp`).
